# Portraits Directory

This folder stores all Honkai Star Rail character portrait images.

- Place each character's portrait here, named by their ID (e.g., `1001.png`, `1002.png`, etc.).
- These images are used by the app to display character portraits in the UI.

**Example:**
```
public/icons/portraits/1001.png
public/icons/portraits/1002.png
```

If you add new characters, place their portrait image in this folder with the correct ID as the filename.
